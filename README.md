# Baking-Badges

> **Note** Right now this uses an example badge from IMS [png file](https://openbadgesvalidator.imsglobal.org/SampleResources/OB20-assertion1-conformance.png)

`illinois.png` is the original png image

`output.png` is the png image with the metadata baked into it

You can verify that the baked image contains metadata which can be use to verify a badge by uploading it to one of these OpenBadge Validator services
- [Badgr Validator](https://badgecheck.io)
- [IMS Validator](https://openbadgesvalidator.imsglobal.org)
